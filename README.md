# Project: Library

This website's purpose is to create a simple card-based layout to display the books you've read or didn't.

The book informations are sent as a form to the script, processed as an object and displayed in a grid layout.

### Limitations

Currently there is no way to store the books you add to the website's page, meaning that if you reload the page all the books you've added are gone.
